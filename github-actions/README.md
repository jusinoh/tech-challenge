# Security Considerations in Terraform Configuration

1. **S3 Bucket Encryption**
   - Ensures that all objects stored in the S3 bucket are encrypted at rest using AES-256, providing an additional layer of security for data stored in the bucket.

2. **S3 Bucket ACL**
   - Sets the access control list (ACL) to `private`, ensuring that the S3 bucket and its contents are not publicly accessible.

3. **S3 Bucket Versioning**
   - Enables versioning on the S3 bucket, allowing recovery of previous versions of objects, which can be crucial in case of accidental deletions or overwrites.

4. **S3 Bucket Website Configuration**
   - Configures the bucket for static website hosting with specified index and error documents.

5. **CloudFront Origin Access Identity (OAI)**
   - Creates an OAI to restrict direct access to the S3 bucket only through CloudFront, adding a layer of security by preventing direct access to the bucket's contents.

6. **CloudFront Viewer Protocol Policy**
   - Ensures that all requests to the CloudFront distribution are redirected to HTTPS, providing secure communication between clients and the distribution.

7. **Geo Restriction**
   - Restricts access to the CloudFront distribution to specified countries, reducing the risk of unauthorized access from other locations.

8. **WAF**
   - Reviews all incoming traffic and applies various rulesets against it to identify malicious traffic.

# Security Considerations in CI/CD Pipeline

1. **AWS Credentials Configuration**
   - Uses GitHub Secrets to securely store and access AWS credentials, ensuring that sensitive information is not exposed in the repository or logs.

2. **Checkmarx KICS Scan**
   - Integrates a static code analysis tool (Checkmarx KICS) to scan for security issues in the Terraform code, ensuring potential vulnerabilities are identified and addressed before deployment.
